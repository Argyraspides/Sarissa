### 1. **C++ PE:**

#### Integration with Web Interface:

- **Define C++ API:** Design a clear and concise API in C++ that the web interface can use to communicate with the physics engine.
- **Compile to WebAssembly (optional):** Consider using WebAssembly to run C++ code directly in web browsers.

#### Physics Engine Components:

- **Collision Detection and Resolution:** Implement the collision detection and resolution logic in C++.
- **Rigid Body Dynamics:** Code the simulation of rigid body motion, including position and velocity updates.
- **Force and Torque Calculations:** Implement the calculation of forces and torques acting on objects.
- **User Interaction:** Allow the C++ engine to receive external inputs, potentially from the web interface.

#### Numerical Stability and Optimization:

- **Address Numerical Stability:** Ensure numerical stability in the C++ code, especially when dealing with fast-moving objects.
- **Performance Optimization:** Optimize critical sections of the C++ code for better performance.

### 2. **Web Interface:**

#### Front-End Development:

- **HTML/CSS/JavaScript:** Build the web interface using these technologies.
- **User Controls:** Implement controls for interacting with the physics simulation, linking to the C++ API.
- **Graphics Rendering:** Use WebGL or other graphics libraries to render the simulation in the browser.

#### User Interaction:

- **Event Handling:** Set up event handlers for user interactions (e.g., button clicks, slider adjustments).
- **Input Validation:** Validate user inputs on the web interface before passing them to the C++ engine.

#### Real-Time Updates:

- **Asynchronous Communication:** Use asynchronous communication to update the web interface in real-time based on the C++ engine's state changes.
- **WebSockets (optional):** Implement real-time communication to synchronize the web interface with the C++ engine.

#### Error Handling and Feedback:

- **Error Messages:** Provide clear error messages on the web interface in case of issues with user input or communication with the C++ engine.
- **Feedback Mechanisms:** Implement visual feedback to indicate the state of the simulation or any ongoing processes.

### 3. **Deployment:**

#### Hosting:

- **Static File Hosting:** Host the web interface files (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) on a static file server.
- **C++ Engine Deployment:** Distribute the compiled C++ physics engine alongside the web interface files.

### 4. **Documentation:**

- **API Documentation:** Clearly document the C++ API that the web interface relies on.
- **User Interface Guides:** Create guides for users on how to navigate the web interface and interact with the simulation.

### 5. **Testing:**

- **Unit Testing:** Write unit tests for the C++ physics engine.
- **Integration Testing:** Test the interaction between the web interface and the C++ engine.
- **Cross-Browser Testing:** Ensure the web interface works on different browsers.

### 6. **Security:**

- **Input Validation:** Secure the web interface by validating user inputs and preventing potential security risks.
- **User Permissions:** If applicable, implement user authentication and authorization to control access.

### 7. **User Support and Feedback:**

- **Support Channels:** Set up channels for user support, such as forums, documentation, or a contact form.
- **Feedback Mechanisms:** Provide a way for users to provide feedback on the web interface and report issues.
