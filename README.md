This is the source code for my developer portfolio website. It uses the React library for the front-end, and will
soon include a much improved port of my physics engine which you can check out [here](https://github.com/Argyraspides/Chiron), through Emscripten and WebAssembly. 
A fully-fledged fluid dynamics and particle simulator will also be added in the future â€” with many more mini-projects that I find interesting to come :)

  
You can visit the site [here](https://sarissa.vercel.app). If you want to build and run the site from source locally, 
first ensure that you have Node.js installed. You may download it here: [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) <br/><br/>
You can then run the following commands to get up and running (ensure that you are in the "sarissa" directory):

```npm install # Installs dependencies specified in sarissa/package.json```

```npm start # Starts the site```


The site should launch on your default browser, hosted locally. If it doesn't launch automatically, open up any browser and navigate to the URL "localhost:3000"
