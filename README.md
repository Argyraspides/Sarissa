<p>This is the source code for my developer portfolio website, currently in development. It uses the React library for the front-end, and will
soon include a much improved port of my physics engine (which you may check out in my repo, named "Chiron") through Emscripten and WebAssembly. 
A fully-fledged fluid dynamics and particle simulator will soon be added â€” with many more mini-projects that I find interesting to come :)

<br/>
<br/>
Currently, the site isn't hosted on the internet. If you want to check it out for yourself, first ensure that you have Node.js installed. You may download it here: https://nodejs.org/en <br/><br/>
You can then run the following commands to get up and running (ensure that you are in the "sarissa" directory):
<br/>
<p>

```npm install # Installs dependencies specified in sarissa/package.json```
<br/>
```npm start # Starts the site```

<p>
  The site should launch on your default browser, hosted locally. If it doesn't launch automatically, open up any browser and navigate to the URL "localhost:3000"
