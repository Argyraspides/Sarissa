This is the source code for my developer portfolio website, currently in development. It uses the React library for the front-end, and will
soon include a much improved port of my physics engine (which you may check out in my repo, named "Chiron") through Emscriptem and WebAssembly. 
A fully-fledged fluid dynamics and particle simulator will soon be added â€” with many more mini-projects that I find interesting to come :)
